For privacy reasons, this repository doesn't contain the code allowing:
- **generate_dataset_mturk.ipynb**: generate a dataset of speech samples with noise and reverberation; create the files required for running a subjective test and label the dataset with perceived quality.
- **data_study.ipynb**: analyze the results of the subjective test and compare them with POLQA scores.
- **model.ipynb**: train a model on the resulting dataset to predict the MOS for each sample.
- **demo.py**: evaluate the perceived quality of speech samples.

But the [report](https://github.com/helleweiss/speech_quality/blob/main/report.pdf) is public!

This project is a result of an internship at Logitech. A publication may follow.
